## Description
 <p>in this project I wanted to make a "blockchain", but maybe it didn't come out the best way, or I didn't quite understand how a blockchain works.</p>
 <p>there are many errors throughout the application, so look at the last branch if you have some silly errors</p>
 
## How to project work
  <p>People and companies can create coins, each currency can have a goal or a way to spend it on products differently. They can make transactions and exchange currencies.</p>
